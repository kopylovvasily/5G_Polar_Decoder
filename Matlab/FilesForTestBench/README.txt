# THIS FOLDER CONTAINS THE MATLAB CODE THAT WAS USED TO TEST THE DECODER

## Files:

	-Startup: Needs to be run frist in order to account for quantization
	-Generating_Simvectors: File which generates the stimuli and expected response 
	-From_binary_TO_2_Complement: Converts decimal to binary by the number of integers and floating numbers that you want
	-fixedSCLDecoder: Modified Fixed SCL Decoder to produce always 512 outputs instead of K bits as outputs (Same as RTL Model)
	-Construct_no_PC: Modified File from Mathworks which produces Frozen bit pattern without taking into account Parity Check(Same as RTL Model)
	-finaltest: Generate SimVectors for the Decoder in a different way (not very used by us, so you can disregard this file)
	-Deinterleaver: Deinterleaver
